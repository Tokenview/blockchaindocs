# Faucet

​	The crypto faucet sites earn revenue from the different activities through a revenue-sharing arbitrage model. For example, crypto faucets can redirect users toward advertising networks and earn revenue from the same. Subsequently, crypto faucets could distribute a specific share of the revenue as crypto rewards to the users. At the same time, you must also note that crypto faucets don’t offer humongous crypto rewards. On the contrary, the small crypto rewards gradually amount to a reasonable sum which users can redeem later.
